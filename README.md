## Example

### The module displays activity information in one of two modes

* `table` mode, which includes
  * The number of activities for the period.
  * The total distance for the period.
  * The total elevation gain for the period. (optional)
  * The total moving time for the period. (optional)
  * The total elapsed time for the period. (optional)
  * The (medium) pace or speed for the period. Running pace is calculated in min/km, riding speed in km/h, swimming speed in min/100m (optional)
  * The total number of achievements (recent period only).
* `chart` mode, which includes
  * The total distance, moving time and elevation for the last week.
  * A chart showing the total distance by day (for `recent` period) or month (for `ytd` period).

### In addition you can configure the following options

* Which `activities` (and the order activities) should be displayed.
* Which `stats` should be displayed in `table` mode.
* Which `period` to display stats for your activities: Recent (last 4 weeks in `table` mode or current week in `chart` mode), year to date or all time (only applicable in `table` mode).
* Whether the module should rotate through the different periods, and the interval between rotations. (only applicable in `table` mode)
* The units (miles/feet or kilometres/metres) used to display the total distance and elevation gain for each activity.
* The locale used for determining the date (day or month) labels in the chart.

## Installation

1. Stop your MagicMirror and clone the repository into the modules folder

   ````bash
   cd ~/MagicMirror/modules
   git clone https://github.com/ianperrin/MMM-Strava.git
   npm install --production
   ````

2. Create a Strava API Application and note the `client_id` and `client_secret`

    * Browse to your [My API Application](https://www.strava.com/settings/api) page and log in to Strava if prompted.
    * Make a note of the `client_id` and `client_secret`

3. Add the module to the config file (`~/MagicMirror/config/config.js`) for your mirror.

   ````javascript
   modules: [
       {
           module: "MMM-Strava",
           position: "top_right",
           config: {
               client_id: "your_strava_application_id",
               client_secret: "your_strava_api_access_token"
           }
       }
   ]
   ````

   The full list of config options can be found in the [configuration options](#configuration-options) table.

4. Authenticate the module to allow access to the Strava API.

    * Browse to the Strava authentication page: [http://localhost:8080/MMM-Strava/auth/](http://localhost:8080/MMM-Strava/auth/) - _the exact URL may vary depending on your configuration._
    * Select the module you wish to authenticate (e.g. `module_4_MMM-Strava`) and click/tap *Authorise* -_The number of the modules will vary depending on your configuration._
    * On the Strava Authorisation page, select the level of access you wish to give to the Magic Mirror, and click/tap *Authorize* - _the module requires at least `View data about your public profile` and `View data about your activities` but it's up to you whether you want to allow access to `private activities`._
    * Once the successful authorisation message appears, restart your Magic Mirror.

## Updating the module

To update the module to the latest version,

1. Pull the changes from this repository into the MMM-Strava folder:

   ````bash
   cd ~/MagicMirror/modules/MMM-Strava
   git pull
   npm install --production
   ````

2. Update your config file to remove the `strava_id` and `access_token` options and add the new `client_id` and `client_secret` options - *See steps 2 and 4 in the [installation notes](#installation)*.

**Please Note** Following the changes to Stravaâ€™s [authentication model](https://developers.strava.com/docs/authentication/)  is available.To support the new authentication flow, the client_id and client_secret must be included in the config in place of the deprecated strava_id and access_token options. The legacy options can still be used, but will trigger an alert on the mirror when the module is loaded and it is recommended they are removed.

If you haven't changed the module, this should work without any problems. If you have a problem, you can reset the module using `git reset --hard`, after which `git pull` should be possible. You may wish to use `git status` to see any changes before doing so.
